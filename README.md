This project is for hosting a webchat that connects
via websockets to an OSRS bot client, which forwards messages.

The original use case was to forward zezima cc messages from
some bot account. This way, the clan chat could be viewed for
entertainment, without having to run a game client. 

Webchat protocol needs defined.
